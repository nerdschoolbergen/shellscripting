*List the contents of the directory you are currently standing in*

```
ls -la
```

*Print the path to the current working directory*

Use the `pwd` command (Print working directory)

*List the hidden files (if any) in a directory (hint: in unix, hidden files starts with dot (".ssh"))*

```bash
ls -a 
# or
ls -la
```

*List all `txt` files in a the `files` directory with human-readable size references (e.g. Megabytes) ordered by the last-modified date*  

```bash
# Lists the files
-ls -l 

# Shows the files with Megabyte size references
--block-size=M

# Sort by last modified date 
-t 

# Complete command
ls -lt --block-size=M

# If you want to reverse the order, add the -r flag
ls -ltr --block-size=M
```

*Find the location of your `git` executable.*

`which git` will show you the location of your git executable.

*Listen to the tail end of the file `file1.txt` in the `files` folder. Try adding new content to the file*

tail -f file1.txt
```

*List the contents of your PATH variable*
```
echo $PATH
