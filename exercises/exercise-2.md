# Exercise 2 - Basics of the shell

You will learn to:

- Navigate through files and directories using a shell
- Create simple bash scripts

From here you'll need to use Google more and more to complete the tasks. You can also check out the [main page](../README.md) where we've listed some of the most commonly used commands (Helpful resources section). 

:bulb: Googling is NOT cheating :-)

## 2.1 - Files and directories

:pencil2: Start by opening your terminal application.

:exclamation: __macOS Catalina users__: The default shell in macOS Catalina is set to `zsh`. This means that after you open Terminal, you will need to start bash by typing `bash` and then pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Alternatively, you can set the default shell to `bash` by following [this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/444596/how-to-change-the-default-shell-to-bash-in-macos-catalina/).

### 2.1.1 - In your terminal

These first tasks are all about getting comfortable in your terminal, and execute some common commands.

:pencil2: List the contents of the directory you are currently standing in

:pencil2: Print the path to the current working directory

:pencil2: List the hidden files (if any) in a directory (hint: in unix, hidden files starts with dot (".ssh"))

:pencil2: List all `txt` files in a the `files` directory with human-readable size references ordered
  by the last-modified date.

Hint: See the help documentation for the `ls` command's `l`, `t`, `r`, and `h` switches

:pencil2: Find the location of your `git` executable.

:pencil2: Listen to the tail end of the file `file1.txt` in the `files` folder. Try adding new content to the file.
:question: How do you exit from the live view of the file?

:pencil2: List the contents of your PATH variable

:pencil2: Create a new directory and add this directory to your PATH variable. Verify that it was added by repeating the previous step.
