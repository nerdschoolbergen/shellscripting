# Exercise 4 - Number guessing game

You will learn to:

- Use loops
- Use if, else and elif blocks

Create a number guessing game. The user should be asked to enter a number between 1 and 100. A random number should be generated, which the user will guess.

If the user's guess is too low or too high, the script should print a descriptive message (E.g. `Your guess is too low`). If the user guesses the correct answer, the script should print out the number of tries, before exiting. 

Here is some example execution:
```
Please enter a number between 1 and 100
Number: 50
The number is too low
Number: 75
The number is too high
Number: 66
The number is too high
Number: 57
The number is too low
Number: 60
The number is too high
Number: 59
The number is too high
Number: 58
Wooho! You guessed it using 7 tries.
```

:star: Bonus: Can you validate that only integers are read into the program?
