### 1.1 - Create bash scripts

Finally, some scripting! These tasks require you to create bash scripts that you can execute in your shell.

:pencil2: Use a for loop to print out the first few lines of each file in a directory. Try to do this both as a script and as a one-liner in the shell

:pencil2: Make a variable containing the path of a directory or a file that exists in your filesystem.
Make a test that checks whether the path is a directory or a regular file. Print `Directory` if the path is a directory, or `File` if the path is a regular file. Create a script that you can run to check the status of the path currently stored in your variable (e.g. `./filecheck.sh`).

:star: Bonus: Instead of storing the path of the file or folder you want to check, can you pass it inn as a parameter to the script? (E.g. `./filecheck.sh /home/myfolder`).

:star: Bonus: Are you able to use the variable containing the file or directory, printing the path of the file in the output? E.g. `"/home/root/file.txt" is a file`.
