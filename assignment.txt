Hottest tip: Google is your friend.

Exercise 1: Using a text editor in the terminal
- Open vi or vim from the terminal
- Add some text
- Save the file
- Turn on syntax highlighting in the text editor
- Close vim
- Make your own .vimrc file by editing it in vim. You should include syntax
  highlighting and convert tabs to spaces
- make an alias so that WQ and Wq behave like the wq command

Exercise 2: Basics of the shell
- List the contents of the directory you are currently standing in
- Print the path to the current working directory
- List the hidden files (if any) in a directory
- List all java files in a directory with human-readable size references ordered
  by the last-modified date
- Find your java executable
- Use a for loop to print out the first few lines of each file in a directory
- Try to do the previous task both as a script and as a one-liner in the shell
- Make a variable containing the name of a directory. Make a test that checks
  whether the name is a directory or a regular file. Print out the line "This is
  a directory" if the variable names a directory. Try to print out the name of
  the directory using the variable so that the line reads "commandLineTips.txt
  is not a directory"
- List out files in /var/log/ and listen to the tail end of the most recently
  used log file. This means that any new messages should appear in your
  terminal. How do you exit from this command?


Exercise 3: deploy via a script 
We've set up a box on the amazon cloud that you can use for this exercise.
In this exercise you should write a script that can:
- make sure you're in the same directory as your script is in (test this by
  executing the script from other directories and print the current working
  directory before and after the command)
- download the files in https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-java to your
  local laptop
- compile all the java files in the JSON directory to a classes/
  directory 
- make a zip file of the classes directory
- ssh into the box using the login information given in the workshop
- upload your zip file
- unzip the uploaded file into a directory (use your name for directory like so:
  siv_hollup or eirik_aardal)
- print out log information after compiling, uploading and unzipping

Done with time to spare?
Try to make your deploy-script use parameters with getopts! 
- the parameters and their uses are: 
    -d cleans the build, that is deletes all compiled classes and the directory
    they've been put in
    -c compiles all java source files in a classes directory
    -z zip all class files
    -u upload zip file to remote location and unzip

Still want more? 
Use the JSON java directory that you downloaded in the earlier exercises. 
- Try to extract all the lines that define public functions from the code files. Can
  you exclude class names?
- Make a script that recursively finds all the java files below the directory
  you're in. For each file, it should extract the function names and put the
  result into a new file (all the function names from all files into one file)
- Make your bash script directly executable so that you only have to type
  "./myScript.sh" rather than "bash myscript.sh"
- Try to remove everything but the function names from each line. Example:
    public void removePrefixOfFunctionName(String line) {
  would become
removePrefixOfFunctionName(String line)
  or even just
removePrefixOfFunctionName
